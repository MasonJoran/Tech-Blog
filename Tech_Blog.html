	<h2>Jobs And Automation</h2>
<h3>by Mason Joran</h3>
	<img src="https://noczone-fvdefpncfaxtmfnyjx.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/robot_overlords.jpg" id="img1">
		
		<h3>Summary</h3>
	
	<p class="paragraphs"> The video "Humans Need Not Apply" brings up the concern of automation within the job industry and how it is capable of putting many people out of a job as it is more cost effective and lacks any sort of human error. Furthermore, it is brought up that no job is safe from full automation and that as a society we must be prepared for when the time comes or else many consequences will arise.</p>
	
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
	
	<p class="paragraphs"> Automation of the job industry is something that will and is going to happen due to rapid advancements in technology, however, full automation of the industry is unlikely as certain jobs require a human feel that cannot be replicated by robots, yet. As a society we will need to brace ourselves for automation within the job industry or else a bigger problem will arise as a result, poverty and homelessness are two such problems that will likely arise as a result of automation and loss of jobs within the industry.</p>

	<h2>Technology in Society</h2>
<h3>by Mason Joran</h3>

		<h3>Summary (Blown To Bits Reading)</h3>

<h4>How Sites Know Who You Are</h4>
	<p class="paragraphs">All websites that we visit have information on who we are due to us either logging into their services, the data they leave behind (cookies), or from our ip address.</p>

<h4>You Pay for the Mike, We'll Just Listen In</h4>
	<p class="paragraphs">Federal authorities are able to use certain technology to their advantage so as to listen into conversations without a person knowing, this is considered a legal form of wiretapping as people are able to prevent it.</p>

<h4>The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think</h4>
	<p class="paragraphs">A preventative measure being taken to stop auto-thieves from skipping large parking bills is being questioned as it constantly photographs a persons license plate as they enter, however, we don't know who is allowed to access this information and it turns our visits to the garage to be not so private.</p>
		
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
	<p class="paragraphs">The 'Blown to Bits' reading provides valuable insight and gives an idea on how technology is used in certain ways within our society to store information and help combat crime. Firstly, all websites tend to store your information when you visit their sites which gives them an idea to who we are. Some sites sell your information to companies for advertising purposes so that the company knows what to market towards you. I don't view this as a problem for me personally but for others it can be seen as a breach of privacy as they didn't give consent for their information to be sold. Secondly, technology starts to become more intrusive in different situations, for example, federal authorities have been listening into private conversations, without people's knowledge, in an effort to prevent crime from happening in the first place and excuse this form of 'wiretapping' by prompting people to turn off their cellular devices to prevent unwanted listeners, this excuse has held up and allows for this form of 'wiretapping' to be legal as you are able to prevent it. This is when technology and its place in society starts to become a problem for some people as its implications can be a breach of privacy but can also be beneficial in a sense that it helps prevent crime, frankly, the problem with technology becomes a slippery slope and lacks any clear solution that is without fault.   </p>
